          <h1>Why Computer Scinece</h1>
          <p>
            I chose Computer Science Engineering because I have always been fascinated by how technology shapes our world. From a young age, I was curious about how computers work and how software applications are built. This curiosity led me to pursue CSE as my career path.
During my studies at VNIT, I have learned various programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and software development principles. I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of programming and the satisfaction of creating working applications from scratch.

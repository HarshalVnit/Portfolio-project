        <h1>MY PROJECTS</h1>
        <br>
        <P>
            Here are some of the projects I have worked on during my academic journey 
at VNIT Nagpur. These projects have helped me apply my theoretical knowledge 
and develop practical programming skills. Each project taught me something 
new about software development and problem-solving.
        </P>

            Project 1
            <br>
            <a href="https://github.com/HarshalVnit/BUS-TRANSPORTATION-SYSTEM" target="_blank">GITHUB LINK</a>
        </h1>
        <h2>Bus Network Management System</h2>
        
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A C++ console-based application that manages a city’s bus network efficiently. It allows administrators to add stops and routes, while passengers can search for stops, view routes, find the shortest path, and book or cancel tickets. The system solves the problem of manually managing and navigating bus routes by automating data handling and route optimization using Dijkstra’s algorithm.</p>

        <h2>Technologies used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>C++ (Core Language)</li>
            <li>File Handling (CSV data storage)</li>
            <li>Graph Data Structure (Adjacency List Representation)</li>
            <li>Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path Calculation)</li>
            <li>STL (Standard Template Library – vectors, maps, priority queue)</li>
            <li>Console I/O for User Interaction</li>
        </ul>

            Project 2 <br><a href="https://github.com/HarshalVnit/Bank-Management" target="_blank" >GITHUB LINK</a>
        </h1>
        <h2>Bank Management System</h2>
    
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A C++ console-based application designed to manage basic banking operations efficiently. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and update or delete account information. The system solves the problem of manual record-keeping by storing all customer and transaction data using file handling, ensuring data persistence between program runs.</p>
